Generating smooth motion profiles for joint angles, velocities, and accelerations

PUMA 560 Robot configuration taken from Peter Corke's RVC Toolbox. Generates two smooth motion profiles for two trajectories using **jtraj** function. The trajectories are given between two points defined by the joint configuration qz and qr, and qr and qf respectively.
